This file describes what to do with the .bz2 files you see elsewhere
on this site (ftp.kernel.org).

.bz2 files are created by bzip2, a file compressor written by Julian
Seward.  bzip2 is a freely available (GPL'd) data compressor, with a
user interface similar to that of GNU gzip.  For further details, the
bzip2 home page is at:

	http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/

The bzip2 software is available at:

	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/bzip2/

bzip2 is no longer maintained at kernel.org; however, we have a mirror
of it at:

	ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/sources.redhat.com/bzip2/
